# Monorepo with Lerna to Design System

> A Monorepo with multiple packages and a shared build, test, and release process.

- 🐉 [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)  - The Monorepo manager
- 📦 [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)  -  Sane multi-package management
- 🚀 [React](https://reactjs.org/)  -  JavaScript library for user interfaces
- 💅 [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)  -  CSS in JS elegance
- 🛠 [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)  -  Compiles next-gen JavaScript
- 📖 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - UI Component Environment
- 🃏 [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)  -  Unit/Snapshot Testing

## Usage

- `yarn dev` - This starts Storybook for viewing all the components locally.
- `yarn bootstrap` - This installs all of the packages and links dependent packages together.
- `yarn build` - This babelfies all of the packages and creates `/lib` folders for each one.
- `yarn test` - Run all linting and unit tests before committing.
- `yarn test -o` - Run only the tests that have changed.
- `yarn test -u` - Update all of the snapshot tests.

## Lerna

- `lerna changed` - Show which packages have changed.
- `lerna diff` - Show specifically what files have cause the packages to change.

## Linking

When linking inside of the Monorepo, everything works as expected. If you are trying to consume packages from this Monorepo _in a different application_ locally, using `npm link` or `yarn link` [does not work as expected](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5538). However, we have a workaround for the time being.

1. Run `yarn build`
1. Run `yarn dev`
1. Change the `package.json` of the consumer from `$YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` (which lives inside the monorepo) to `file:./../monorepo/packages/$YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME`
1. Run `rm -rf node_modules && yarn` in the consumer
1. 🎉

## Publish

- Run `npm publish --access public`
